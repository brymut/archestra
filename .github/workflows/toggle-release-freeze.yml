          A release freeze has just been activated. This PR cannot be merged until the freeze is lifted.

          The freeze was enabled manually via the **Toggle Release Freeze** workflow.

          ### How to unfreeze

          1. Go to **Actions** → **Toggle Release Freeze** → **Run workflow**
          2. Select \`false\` from the dropdown
          3. Click **Run workflow**

          Once the freeze is lifted, this review will be dismissed automatically.
